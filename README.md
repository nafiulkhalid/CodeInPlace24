**MyLife - Personal Diary Application**
--> Final Project @ Code in Place 2024 - Stanford University

**Description**
This is my final project for the special online course Code In Place 2024 by Stanford University. This project implements the core concepts from CodeInPlaceâ€™s course lectures such as variables, lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, and random library.

**MyLife offers users to:**
1. Add a diary page by date
2. Search from existing writings
3. Get a list of previous notes
4. Delete a note by date
Even if the program is restarted, my project stores previous responses.

**StoryLine:**
While sitting at my study table, pondering over my final project, my eyes wandered to my personal daily diary, nestled amidst a pile of books. In that moment, inspiration struck. I realized that this diary, a simple yet essential part to record my daily emotions, could be transformed into a unique coding project. With excitement, I knew I had found the perfect idea to bring to life.

**Instructions:**
Ensure to download both the files (project.py & diary.txt) and enjoy the program locally!
